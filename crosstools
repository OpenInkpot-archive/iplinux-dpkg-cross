# This configuration file is used by dpkg-cross wrappers to choose
# binutils to use with different targets.
# Currently, this is used to choose 'strip' and 'objdump'.
# If no information is given here, an attempt will be made to autodetect
# proper tool, and /usr/bin/<tool> will be used if nothing better is found.

# This file may be in /etc/dpkg-cross/crosstools or ~/.dpkg-cross/crosstools

# <arch> <tool> <mode> <pathname>
