dpkg-cross (1.99+2.0.0pre2) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of dpkg-cross has been extensively refactored and
  includes a new Perl module with a new API.
  .
  The dpkg-buildpackage and dpkg-shlibdeps diversions have been
  removed due to increased cross-building support in dpkg-dev.
  The customised versions of objcopy, objdump and strip have also been
  removed due to the new dependency on binutils-multiarch.
  .
  As dpkg-cross is merged gradually back into dpkg, parts of the
  old dpkg-cross will be removed from the package and simply stored
  in CVS. Maintaining the old versions during the current changes in 
  the Debian::DpkgCross module is impractical and it is unlikely that 
  the CVS versions will be usable with the released package as the 
  old code is increasingly left behind. Functions listed as "Legacy code"
  in the module are likely to be removed in due course.
  .
  The next stage is expected to be the migration of the cross-config.$arch
  files into dpkg-dev along with a method to replicate the gccross 
  script currently used by dpkg-cross.
  .
  The dpkg-cross 'core' functionality of preparing Architecture:all
  packages of development headers and shared objects for use in a cross
  build is expected to be retained outside dpkg until such time as the
  other components are successfully merged and a suitable method is 
  available to implement support for cross-building within dpkg and apt.
  .
  This will then result in both dpkg-cross and apt-cross being removed
  from Debian in preference for the integrated cross building support
  within dpkg and apt.
  .
  The 2.x series of dpkg-cross will therefore aim to achieve its own
  removal.
  .
  Once this happens, dpkg-dev will conflict with and replace dpkg-cross
  to ensure the removal of the old code.

dpkg-cross (1.26) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of dpkg-cross uses new paths to default cross-compile
  environment, to follow changes in debian arch aliases.
  E.g. it uses arm-linux-gnu instead of arm-linux.
  .
  Because of this, -arch-cross packages created by this version
  are not compatable with those created by previous versions. Some
  dependency magic was added to make incompatable combination less
  probable, but there are some situations when it may not help.
  Because of this, it's better to recreate all -arch-cross packages
  using this version of dpkg-cross.
  .
  Also, to actually cross-compile debian packages, new versions of
  cross-toolchain packages are required. Appropriate patches for gcc-4.0
  have been submitted, and should be available since gcc-4.0 4.0.2-6.
  Cross-patches for binutils package, as well as not-yet-included
  cross-patches for gcc packages, are at
    http://zigzag.lvk.cs.msu.su/~nikita/debian/cross-patches
  Binary cross-toolchain i386 debs for different targets are at
    http://zigzag.lvk.cs.msu.su/~nikita/debian/sid/

dpkg-cross (1.24) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of dpkg-cross uses /etc/dpkg-cross and ~/.dpkg-cross instead
  of /etc/dpkg and ~/.dpkg. Dpkg-cross files will be moved from /etc/dpkg
  to /etc/dpkg-cross automatically during upgrade. If you have any dpkg-cross
  files in ~/.dpkg directory, please move those to ~/.dpkg-cross directory
  manually.
